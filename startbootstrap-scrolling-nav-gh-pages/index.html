                        In the end of June, UK voters decided the fate of the country in a referendum over Britainâ€™s continuing membership of the European Union (EU).
                        Under such circumstance, the economy of UK could be affected.
                        <strong>The project mainly concerns about whether household consumption has been effected by Brexit.</strong>

                        Following the EU referendum, the value of sterling fell sharply against the dollar at the end of June and
            into July. In July 2016,the sterling Exchange Rate Index (ERI) was 15% lower compared with July 2015 and 6.6% lower compared with
            the average level in June 2016.
            In August 2016 and September 2016, the exchange rate showed some signs of increasing, however the value of
            sterling fell continued decreasing after September 2016.
            Figure 1 shows British Pound (GBP) to US Dollar (USD) exchange rate from 01/01/2014 to 31/10/2016. This
            indicates that the pound has fallen against the dollar, following
            the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
            The falling pound leads to the import price increasing.

                         This figure shows the index of import price from May 2014 to October 2016 compared with that of in 2013 and the standard in 2013 is 100.
            Then index of import price shows a slight fluctuate before referendum and it average at 90.7 in the fist 6 month of 2016.Then it rise up considerably after referendum to 95.2 in July 2016.
            The data is trend to stable in the next 3 months from July to September and then experience a dramatic growth to 97. 8.
            Compared with the exchange rate between the pound to dollar, we can find that the trend form this two graph show a crosscurrent.
            In the fist month of referendum, the Sterling exchange rate shapely decrease and the import price shapely increase.
            In the July, August and September, the Sterling exchange rate tends to be stable and the import price shows the same tendency.
            Then the October saw a dramatic drop while the import price keep an upward tendency.
            Thus the referendum influences the import price through the Sterling exchange rate.
            After referendum, the Sterling exchange rate going down and the import price show a rise trend.

                      Consumer price inflation is the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households fall or
            rise.
            Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices.
            The easy way to understand this is to assume that a very large shopping basket contains all the goods and
            services bought by households,and movements in price index represent the changing cost of this basket.

            </br>The price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common way is to find
            how the index has changed over a year. To calculate price index, comparing the price index for the latest
            month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate.

            </br>The CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation created to international standards. Figure shows UK's
            CPI 12-month inflation rate from January 2014 to October 2016.
            It shows that consumer price inflation suddenly rose in September. The annual rate of CPI inflation was 1
            per cent, up from 0.6 per cent in July

                            This figure shows the price of household consumption and the index of the amount of expenditure relative to the volume in 2013.
                            Current price: It represents the value of consumption price in a quarter.
                        Chained volume measure: The estimation of the volume of goods and services that household consumed.
                        The value of price and the amount of consumer goods keep an upward tendency science since the first quarter in 2014.
                        However it show a more obvious growth after Brexit vote.
                        The current price quarter 3 (2016) increased by 1.3% compared with the value in quarter 2(2016) and quarter 2 compared with quarter 1 in 2016, experiencing 0.6% growth.
                        Looking the index of the chained volume measure, they rose up by 0.7% and 1.0% respectively when the data in quarter 3 compared with quarter 2 and quarter 2 compared with quarter 2.
