                        On 23 June 2016, the Brexit referendum about whether the United Kingdom should leave or stay at the European Union(EU) took place.
                        The 51.89% of the voters voted in the favour of leaving the EU. After this decision the UK is facing uncertainty and financial cost.
                        Along with the Brexit, British face an impact on the economy and as a result on their spending.

                        Following the EU referendum, the value of sterling fell sharply against dollar. The day after the referendum, pound was
                        more than 10% down, leading to the lowest rate since 1985 and to one of the biggest one-day loss in history.
                        In July 2016,the sterling Exchange Rate Index (ERI) was 15% lower compared with July 2015 and 6.6% lower compared with
            the average level in June 2016.
            In August 2016 and September 2016, the exchange rate showed some signs of increasing, however the value of sterling continues falling.
            <!--sterling fell continued decreasing after September 2016.-->
            In Figure 1 the exchange rate of British Pound (GBP) against US Dollar (USD) depicts this drop of pound.
                The falling pound leads to a break down of the UK's economy and more precisely to the UK's imports.
                        <!--as now the UK lost the advantage of the high echange rate-->

            <!--Figure 1 shows British Pound (GBP) to US Dollar (USD) exchange rate from 01/01/2014 to 31/10/2016. This-->
            <!--indicates that the pound has fallen against the dollar, following-->
            <!--the UK's vote to leave the European Union.-->
            <!--The falling pound leads to the import price increasing.-->

                         The figure 2 represents the index of import price from May 2014 to October 2016 compared with the index of 2013.
            Then index of import price shows a slight fluctuate before referendum and its average is at 90.7 on the first 6 months of 2016.
             After the referendum, the index of the import price rises up considerably to 95.2 in July 2016.
            The import price continues to increase in the next 3 months (July to September) and then experiences a sharply growth to 97. 8.
            Compared with the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar, it is noted that the import price in the UK depends on the exhange rate and every change in pound leads to a change in import price.
                        <!--we can find that the trend from this two graphs shows a crosscurrent.-->
            In the fist month of referendum, the Sterling sharply decreased and the import price shapely increased.
            In the July, August and September, the Sterling exchange rate tends to be stable and the import price shows the same tendency.
            In October, the pound shows a dramatic drop while the import price keeps an upward tendency.
            Thus, the UK's decision to leave the European Union influences the import price through the Sterling exchange rate.
            After referendum, the Sterling exchange rate keeps going down and the import price shows a rising trend.

                This figure presents the relationship between import price and CPI.
             Import price: the index of import price compared with that of in 2013 and the standard in 2013 is 100.</br></br>
             CPI: consumer price index
            According to scatter distribution, most of data show that index of consumer price is increasing with the rise of the import price.
             Thus they present a positive correlation. After referendum, the import price going up, following the price of imported materials is increasing,
             and then the manufacturing cost of goods show an upward tendency.
             CPI is a index which used to reflect the change in households’ consumption price such as goods and services.
             Thus the relationship between import price and CPI shows the household consumption is growing up after referendum.

                      Consumer price inflation is the rate at which the prices of goods and services bought by households fall or
            rise.
            <!--Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices.-->
            The easiest way to understand this is to assume that a very large shopping basket contains all the goods and
            services bought by households,and the movements in price index represent the changing cost of this basket.

            </br>The price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common way is to find
            how the index has changed over a year. To calculate price index, comparing the price index for the latest
            month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate.

            </br>The CPI is a measure of consumer price inflation created to international standards. Figure shows UK's
            CPI 12-month inflation rate from January 2014 to October 2016.
            It shows that consumer price inflation suddenly rose in September. The annual rate of CPI inflation was 1
            per cent, up from 0.6 per cent in July

                            This figure shows the price of household consumption and the index of the amount of expenditure relative to the volume in 2013.
Current price: It represents the value of consumption price in a quarter.
Chained volume measure: The estimation of the volume of goods and services that household consumed.
The value of price and the amount of consumer goods keep an upward tendency science since the first quarter in 2014.
                        However it show a more obvious growth after Brexit vote.
                        The current price quarter 3 (2016) increased by 1.3% compared with the value in quarter 2(2016) and quarter 2 compared with quarter 1 in 2016, experiencing 0.6% growth.
                        Looking the index of the chained volume measure, they rose up by 0.7% and 1.0% respectively when the data in quarter 3 compared with quarter 2 and quarter 2 compared with quarter 2.
                        Thus the household consumption increasing after referendum.
